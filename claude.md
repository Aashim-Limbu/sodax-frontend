# Planning Workflow

When asked to explore or plan:
1. Use Plan Mode (read-only exploration)
2. Analyze the codebase structure and existing services
3. Write the implementation plan to `plan.md` in the project root
4. Include: architecture overview, files to modify, new files needed, dependencies, and implementation steps

# Plan Format
Plans should include:
- Current state analysis
- Proposed changes
- Step-by-step implementation tasks

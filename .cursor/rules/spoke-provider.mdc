aleo-spoke-provider-source-of-truth = "provable-sdk (in-repo)"

When working on **AleoSpokeProvider** or any Aleo-specific provider logic:

Treat the **in-repo Provable Aleo SDK** as the single source of truth.

Always reference the following packages for correctness:

- @provablehq/sdk
- @provablehq/aleo-types
- packages/types/src/aleo
The published packages:
(@provablehq/sdk in the repo root,
@provablehq/aleo-types inside /aleo-dev-toolkit)
must be treated strictly as **compiled artifacts**, not design references.

Ensure AleoSpokeProvider:

- Aligns with the provider/connector abstractions already used by other chains
- Fully supports all features and behaviors exposed by the Provable Aleo SDK
- Uses Aleo SDK types directly without redefining, wrapping, or renaming them
- Introduces no new abstractions, flows, or naming conventions 

If behavior, APIs, or types differ:

- Prefer the Provable Aleo SDK behavior
- Update AleoSpokeProvider to match the SDK
- Do **not** adapt or bend the SDK to fit existing provider assumptions

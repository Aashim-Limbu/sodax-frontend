aleo-wallet-react-source-of-truth = "in-repo"

When working on any Aleo-related code inside wallet-sdk-react:

Treat the in-repo aleo-dev-toolkit as the canonical source of truth

Always reference the following in-repo paths for correctness:

packages/aleo-wallet-adaptor/core

packages/aleo-wallet-adaptor/react

packages/aleo-wallet-adaptor/react-ui

packages/aleo-wallet-adaptor/wallets

packages/aleo-wallet-standard

packages/aleo-types

The published packages
(@provablehq/aleo-wallet-adaptor-*, @provablehq/aleo-wallet-standard, @provablehq/aleo-types)
must be treated as compiled artifacts, not design references

Ensure the Aleo implementation in wallet-sdk-react:

Matches existing adapter patterns used by other chains

Supports all features exposed by the in-repo Aleo adapters

Introduces no new abstractions, naming conventions, or flow changes
unless they already exist in the in-repo implementation

If behavior or APIs differ:

Prefer the in-repo implementation

Adjust wallet-sdk-react to align, not the other way around

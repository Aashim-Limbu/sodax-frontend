aleo-wallet-core-source-of-truth = "in-repo"

When working on any Aleo-related code inside wallet-sdk-core:

Treat the in-repo Aleo SDK and type definitions as the canonical source of truth

Always reference the following packages for correctness:

- @provablehq/aleo-types
- @provablehq/sdk

The published packages
(@provablehq/aleo-types: this is in /aleo-dev-toolkit folder,
@provablehq/sdk in root folder with /sdk)
must be treated as compiled artifacts, not design references

Ensure the Aleo implementation in wallet-sdk-core:

- Matches the core abstractions and patterns used by other chains
- Fully supports all features and capabilities exposed by the Aleo SDK
- Uses Aleo types directly without redefining, wrapping, or renaming them
- Introduces no new abstractions, naming conventions, or flow changes
  unless they already exist in the Aleo SDK or are required for
  cross-chain consistency already present in wallet-sdk-core

If behavior, APIs, or types differ:

- Prefer the in-repo Aleo SDK implementation
- Adjust wallet-sdk-core to align with Aleo SDK behavior,
  not the other way around
